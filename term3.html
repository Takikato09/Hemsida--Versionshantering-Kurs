    <p>Working directory: The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project.</p>

    <p>Staging: A way to test modifications before they are applied to your actual GitHub Enterprise instance.</p>

    <p>HEAD: A defined commit of a branch, usually the most recent commit at the tip of the branch.</p>

    <p>Revert: When you revert a pull request on GitHub, a new pull request is automatically opened, which has one commit that reverts the merge commit from the original merged pull request. In Git, you can revert commits with git revert.</p>

    <p>Reset: git reset is a powerful command that is used to undo local changes to the state of a Git repo. Git reset operates on "The Three Trees of Git". These trees are the Commit History ( HEAD ), the Staging Index, and the Working Directory.</p>
